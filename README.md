## The Problem

Local businesses like residential contractors don't need much in terms of online marketing, and there are a ton of free and low-cost options for building and
hosting a website.

So why are local sites usually so terrible? So many are slow-loading,
unpolished and rarely updated.

The reason is local business owners don't have the time or the money to devote
to building a thriving web presence. After they get an initial website set up,
it languishes for months and years instead of growing and providing continuous value.

That's like throwing an apple core on the ground and expecting an orchard to grow.

What should they do instead?

- Start with a simple, performant website that has optimized on-page SEO
- Add new content regularly
- Share that content on social-media channels, especially their business profile
  on Google

The formula is straightforward and proven, and there are many services out there
business owners can use to get it done. Yet few small-business owners pull it off.

## The Solution

Kicksplash drastically simplifies the process by starting with a
well-considered default site and then focusing solely on building a strong base of SEO-optimized content.

**Business owners don't need to do anything but approve the website changes we recommend.**

Specifically, Kicksplash solves the problem by providing

1. A simple site optimized out of the box
2. Automatic content creation
3. Automatic content sharing on social media
4. _Access to a human who can answer your questions and provide continuous hands-on help_

It's #4 that separates us from everybody else. When our customers get stuck, we don't ask them to figure it out for themselves. We jump in and help.

## Our Approach

### No Guessing

We're not guessing what our customers want. We're asking them. We're talking to them. We're building what they tell us they need and then figuring out how to make it scalable and profitable.

### Jump In

The first step is to build a simple site that's optimized for SEO and performance and push it live. Then we'll start adding content and sharing it on social media. Then we'll start automating everything and figuring out how to scale it.

### Our Target Market

Residential contractors. We're starting with this niche because it's a market we know well, and it's a market that's underserved by existing solutions.
